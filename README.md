 # bagelsgame
A little logic game where you guess a three digit number and get responses from some nested loops.\
&emsp;Pico   - One digit is correct and in the wrong place.\
&emsp;Fermi  - One digit is correct and in the right place.\
&emsp;Bagles - No digits are correct.\
Bagles.py is where the code's saved.
