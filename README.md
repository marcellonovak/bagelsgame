 # bagelsgame
A little logic game where you guess a three digit number and get responses from some nested loops.\
&emsp;&emsp;Pico: One digit is correct and in the wrong place.\
&emsp;&emsp;Fermi: One digit is correct and in the right place.\
&emsp;&emsp;Bagles: No digits are correct.\
Bagles.py is where the code's saved.
